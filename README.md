# same-stance-challenge.github.io

This is the official website for the same side stance classification challenge

The website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). To install Jekyll on your system, run

    sudo apt install ruby ruby-dev build-essential
    sudo gem install jekyll jekyll-sitemap

After Jekyll is installed, you can `cd` into the main folder of this
repository and run

    jekyll serve

This will start a server at <http://localhost:4000/> serving the compiled
website. If the source files change, the server will automatically recompile
them. The server can be stopped via `Ctrl+C`.

To publish changes to the source files, just push them to GitHub, which will
take care of compiling them on its own. The website is reachable on: https://sameside.webis.de
